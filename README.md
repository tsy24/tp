* **NurseyBook** is an address book and task tracker, targetting staff who are working at nursing homes.

  Example usages:
  * Add details of the elderly that they are in charge of (including their medical conditions and emergency contacts)
  * Add contact details of other nurses
  * Track tasks related to taking care of elderly with varying health conditions

* This is a desktop app ptimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
